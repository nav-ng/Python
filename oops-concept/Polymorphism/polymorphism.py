# polymorphism method:
# 1.method overloading
# 2.method overriding


# Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and describes situations in which
# something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access
# objects of different types through the same interface.


# Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
# Overriding occurs when two methods have the same method name and parameters. One of the methods is in the parent class,
# and the other is in the child class.
